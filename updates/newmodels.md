It’s all about making sure you never have to say "I can't do that one" just because you're missing a file.

### ⚡ Scorpion Bitmaps v1.2: Now Live for ALL iPhones

This is the big one. We’ve rolled out **Scorpion Bitmaps v1.2** across the entire iPhone lineup. This isn't just a fresh coat of paint; it's a completely new way to work.

**World-First: Search *Inside* the Bitmap** 🔍

We're pretty sure we're the only app in the world doing this. You can now search for specific lines—like `VDD_MAIN`—directly inside the bitmap itself.

Forget flipping back and forth between the PDF schematic and the bitmap. Just type the line name, and in less than a second, you're looking right at it. For a lot of your daily repairs, you won't even need to open the schematic file anymore. It’s faster, cleaner, and just makes sense.

**Bitmap Diode Mode** 📉

To make things even smoother, v1.2 brings you diode readings directly on the IC pins within the bitmap. It’s like having a cheat sheet right on your screen, letting you check connections and diagnose faults without the headache of cross-referencing massive lists.
