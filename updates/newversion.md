Hey Scorpion Crew, 🛠️

We've been quietly working on something huge behind the scenes, and today, we're unbelievably excited to pull back the curtain. The biggest, most feature-packed update in the history of Scorpion Repair is finally here.

**Welcome to Scorpion Repair v1.2!**

We're not just adding a few new models (though we've done that too!). We're rolling out four massive features that will fundamentally change how you work, save you money, and open up new ways for you to earn. Let's get right into it.

### 💰 Scorpion Refurbished: Buy, Repair, and Profit—Smarter.

Ever look at a used phone and feel that knot in your stomach, wondering if it's a good deal or a money pit? We're taking the guesswork out of the equation. Completely. Scorpion Refurbished is a suite of 25 dedicated tools designed to walk you from a risky buy to a guaranteed profit.

It's your step-by-step guide through the entire process:

* **Know Before You Buy:** Our tools analyze the market, parts pricing (both original and high-copy), and potential repair costs.
* **Smart Decisions:** Get a clear "BUY" or "SKIP" recommendation based on real data, plus a risk score to keep you safe.
* **From Bench to Bank:** We guide you through grading, repairs, and final sale, always showing you the potential profit. This is your gateway to dominating the high-value "iPhone Renewed" market.

It's now live for a huge range of iPhones, and you can try it completely **FREE** on the iPhone X model to see the power for yourself!

* **Supported iPhones:** X, 11, 11 Pro/Max, 12, 12 Pro/Max, 13, 13 Pro/Max, 14, 14 Pro/Max, and 15.
* **Coming Soon:** Full support for Laptops and Tablets arrives at the end of this month!

### ⚡ Scorpion Bitmaps v1.2: A World-First Revolution.

We had bitmaps before. But this is something else entirely. We're proud to be the **first app in the world** to give you bitmaps with a search bar for Power Nets.

Yeah, you read that right.

No more spending hours hunting for main nets. Just type it in and find it in seconds. This is a massive time-saver that lets you diagnose complex boards faster than ever. It's how **Scorpion makes beginners repair like pros.**

* **Available Now On:** All new Laptop, Tablet, Drone, and AirPods models, plus new phones from Oppo, Realme, and Huawei.
* **Coming Soon:** We're rolling this out to all iPhone models by the end of the month!

### 👨‍🏫 Scorpion Instructor: Teach and Annotate Without Leaving the App.

For all the instructors, professors, and training centers out there—we see you. You're paying for extra software just to teach using schematics. Not anymore.

Scorpion Instructor builds a full set of annotation tools right into the app. Highlight, draw, add text, and guide your students without ever needing to switch windows or pay for another service. It's all part of our promise: one subscription for everything.

### 🌍 Every Device. Every Schematic. One App.

Tired of juggling 3, 4, or even 5 different subscriptions for phones, laptops, and tablets? We were too. So we fixed it.
